<h4 class="notop">The Big Picture</h4>
		<p>In January 2013, PhD student Thomas Talhelm wondered why air purifiers cost so much. He bought a HEPA filter on Taobao, strapped it to a simple fan, bought a particle counter, ran some tests, and published the results on a blog he called Particle Counting.</p>
		<p>A few magazines wrote about Thomas's "re­discovery," and then the Beijing Energy Network suggested he lead DIY workshops to help other concerned Beijingers build their own.</p>
		<p>When people said they had trouble finding the right type of fan and a trustworthy HEPA, Thomas and his friends Gus and Anna decided to launch Smart Air in September 2013 to ship fans and the best HEPAs they could find to people all over China.</p>
		<p>The team believes that if more people saw our open­source data and testing, more people would know that clean air doesn't have to cost thousands of RMB.</p>
	
	<div class="pull-out">
		<p class="pull-quote">&#8220;Filters are actually very simple -- a HEPA filter is all you need to get over 99 percent of the PM 2.5

			<h4>Kicking Things In Gear</h4>
			<p>In the summer of 2013 I came in contact with a funny guy named Gus Tate that happened to be leading an initiative in Beijing to educate people on the production and effectiveness of low-cost, DIY air purification alternatives. I jumped at the chance to volunteer and I quickly fell into place helping Smart Air streamline mostly all of their company assets. After all was said and done, I was able to improve the look and function of their marketing materials, Taobao storefront UX/UI design, educational pamphlets, product photos, promotional test videos, business card designs, workshop posters and many other assets so that the startup was able to better transition into what it is now.</p>
			<p>I was very lucky to have crossed paths with the Smart Air team and, because of my experiences with them, I am better prepared to work with startups/companies (no matter their size, location, or native tongue) and understand what I am capable of in environments of varying levels of pressure, experience, and opinion.</p></p>

	<h4>User Tests</h4>
	
	
	<p>During summer, we designed, tested, and iterated in a cycle in order to create the most effective and easiest to use product. We designed a user test to simulate a NASA facility and instructed participants through it as they used our product.</p>

		<p>One of my many tasks was to take on the features of a future product.</p>
		<p>Along with the many other elements, I drafted and made initital moves to develop a mobile app that would pair with Smart Air's new air purifier and a user's phone.</p>
