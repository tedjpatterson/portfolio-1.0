	<div class="words bottom2-5">
		<p>This program was a 12 week accelerator aimed at software engineers, coders, and hackers working on seed stage companies. It was fast-paced, highly collaborative, and very intense. Designed to help tech entrepreneurs, it helps startups find problem-solution fits, product market fits, and a scalable, repeatable business model and, as the senior design mentor, I was tasked in helping the 6 teams refine and find their face and graphic direction. I ended up advising these teams over the 12 week span working on logos, webstie mockups, slidedeck designs, social media materials, and several other components.</p>

		<h4 class="notop">The Process</h4>
		<p>NASA approached us with a batch of problems. Their astronauts spend way too much time trying to find a tool that someone left in a wrong place. They couldn't get them to keep them where they were supposed to be. And they always feared that a tool was reaching it's overuse expiration, but could never know how much it had been used. So we formed our guiding question:</p>
	
	<div class="pull-out">
		<p class="pull-quote">&#8220;How can we make tool tracking more efficient for astronauts and engineers, within the context of executing procedures? 
		&#8221;	</p>
		<p class="credit">Initial Project Scope</p>
	</div>

	
		<p>
		</p>
		
	</div>
	
		
	<div class="words">
		<h4>Beginning with Research</h4>
		<p>Over the course of the next seven months, my capstone team researched tool tracking in various domains, analyzed products that provide live tracking, read literature ranging from spatial awareness to attention and interruptibility, and proceeded to design and prototype out a solution to the both the problems we were presented with and the problems we found in the field.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="left-img nobottom">

	</div>

	<div class="side-col">
		<p>Contextual Inquiry is a primary research method at NASA because of how useful it is at understanding how indivduals worked. We performed over 20 contextual inquiries on machinists, lab scientists, nurses, and test lab technicians.</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="left-img nobottom">
	
	<img class="nobottom" src="images/nasa/flowmodel.jpg"/></div>

	<div class="side-col">
		<p>We brought our contextual inquiry notes back to our lab and synthesized them with the rest of the group. Seen here is a flow model, which helps us understand how information is flowing between individuals and objects in the space.</p>
		</div>	

	<div class="left-img nobottom">
		<img class="nobottom" src="images/nasa/affinity.jpg"/>
	</div>

	<div class="side-col">
		<p>We created an affinity diagram, consisting of almost 1000 sticky notes, of all the notes from our research. This helped us find frequent issues and areas of opportunity. Here I am with Adam, Vanna White-ing the finally finished affinity board (that's the face she normally makes, right?).</p>
		</div>	

	<div class="words">
		
		<h4>User Tests</h4>
		<p>During summer, we designed, tested, and iterated in a cycle in order to create the most effective and easiest to use product. We designed a user test to simulate a NASA facility and instructed participants through it as they used our product.</p>
		
	</div>
		
	<div class="left-img nobottom">
		<img class="nobottom" src="images/nasa/usertest.jpg"/>

<div class="side-col">
		<p>Here, our participant begins to create a new job in the system while performing a think aloud. After his think aloud, we performed an informal interview to understand some of his choices and confirm his understanding of the product.</p>

			<p>We prototyped out an augmented reality product as we were researching, but user tests made it obvious that the product wasn't suited for their environment.</p>

		<div class="words">
		
		<p>Our findings from user tests helped informed our next design choices and guide the direction of the product.</p>
	
		</div>
		
		
		<div class="words">
				<h4>Prototyping</h4>

		<p>After visioning out ideas and brainstorming with our client on the ideal solution, we created our first prototypes.</p>
		<p>Throughout our 22 user tests, we tested 8 different iterations. We began with paper prototyping our initial ideas, moved into faux-interactive linked screens, then coded a fully-functional database and application.</p>

		<div class="side-col">
		<p>Seen here are a few of the different prototypes during user tests. We also created augmented reality prototypes and smaller wristband prototypes which ended up being passed over due to usability issues.</p>

		<div class="words">
		<p>Our end result was well-received due to it's simplicty and the ease of use upon first picking it up. My favorite quote from our research, though, got at the experience we were trying to create, as it alluded to a problem we had overcome compared to other NASA software:</p>
	<div class="pull-out">
		<p class="pull-quote" style="max-width:550px; ">&#8220;I really appreciate that you remembered that engineers and astronauts are people, too.&#8221;	</h3>

		<p>There are two 140 page books that describe our process for both spring and summer of working with NASA, and so what I show here is only a portion of the project and all of the work we completed.
